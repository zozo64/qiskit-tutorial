    "## Introduction\n",
    "Many people tend to think quantum physics is hard math, but this is not actually true. Quantum concepts are very similar to those seen in the linear algebra classes you may have taken as a freshman in college, or even in high school. The challenge of quantum physics is the necessity to accept counter-intuitive ideas, and its lack of a simple underlying theory. We believe that if you can grasp the following two Principles, you will have a good start: \n",

    "This time, the results are surprising. Unlike the classical case, with high probability the outcome is not random, but in the $|0\\rangle$ state. *Quantum randomness* is not simply like a classical random coin flip. In both of the above experiments, the system (without noise) is in a definite state, but only in the first case does it behave randomly. This is because, in the first case, via the $H$ gate, we make a uniform superposition of the ground and excited state, $(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$, but then follow it with a measurement in the computational basis. The act of measurement in the computational basis forces the system to be in either the $|0\\rangle$ state or the $|1\\rangle$ state with an equal probability (due to the uniformity of the superposition). In the second case, we can think of the second $H$ gate as being a part of the final measurement operation; it changes the measurement basis from the computational basis to a *superposition* basis. The following equations illustrate the action of the $H$ gate on the computational basis states:\n",
    "$$H: |0\\rangle  \\rightarrow  |+\\rangle=\\frac{|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n",

The first $H$ gate prepares the system into a superposition state, namely the $|+\\rangle$ state. The second $H$ gate followed by the standard measurement changes it into a measurement in the superposition basis. If the measurement gives 0, we can conclude that the system was in the $|+\\rangle$ state before the second $H$ gate, and if we obtain 1, it means the system was in the $|-\\rangle$ state. In the above experiment we see that the outcome is mainly 0, suggesting that our system was in the $|+\\rangle$ superposition state before the second $H$ gate. \n",
